#### TABLES TO MATCH STROEYMEYT ET AL., 2018, SCIENCE ####
### ### ### ### ### ### ### ### ### ### ### ### ### ### ### ### 

#### Background information | Read me ####

# Script created by Adriano Wanderlingh, with contributions of  Nathalie Stroeymeyt
# with adaptations by Linda Sartoris and finally adjusted to the needs and data structure of Daniel Schl√§ppi
# Should be compatible with Fort 0.8.1 and 0.8.3

# When running this you will create a couple of tables in the right format with the right names for variables so it should match 
# the data structure of Stroeymeyt 2018 which will help running the remaining analysis pipeline.

#### 2. To dos and Notes ####
# AT SOME POINT IT MIGHT BE NECESSARY TO CHANGE TO THE FACET NETWORK TASK DEFINITION VARIABLE INSTEAD OF THE ONE BASED ON PROPORTION OF TIME IN OR OUR THE NEST
# HOWEVER, THIS SCRIPT NEEDS TO BE RUN BEFORE THE FACET NET ONE... So we might want to come back to at at some point. --> Facet Net was just run afterwards and its information was added in addition to the space use one
# note, seed files etc are all calculated based on the old task definition which was based on the percentage of time spent inside or outside the nest. --> maybe this step still needs to be adjusted.


# CHECK WHICH BELOW IS REFERRING TO BEAD LOAD AND ADJUST ADRIANOS PATHOGEN LOAD. 
# pathogen_load <- read.csv("/media/cf19810/DISK4/EXP1_base_analysis/Personal_Immunity/Pathogen_Quantification_Data/Adriano_qPCR_pathogen_load_MASTER_REPORT.csv")
# bead_load <- read.csv("path to table containing the information of the beads for each individual: blue, yellow") ### UPDATE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE and also update the part below regarding the bead load. 
# Anything further down in the pipeline referring to the pathogen_load table needs to be run with metadata instead.


# Column names might be slightly different based on experimental design...
# AntTask -> AntTask1perc
# I did not have pathogen load but bead load which is included in the metadata table. 
# As I had only 1 Treatment some variable will be different to Adriano and Linda.
# However, I will need to adjust things once I get to further down in the pipeline to address the issue of bead colors. --> should be sorted in the bead data analysis. 

# Time aggregation info might also be needed for the trophallaxis network... check later... if running simulations along the trophallaxis network.

# needed by the simulations
# ev. I need to do the same for the trophallaxis interaction network. However, but probably not as I only had one 3h time block for the pre and the post treatment duration.
